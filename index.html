        <p>a dough made from flour, fat, and water, used as a base or covering for baked goods, which can be sweet or
            savory. The fat creates layers, resulting in a delicate, flaky, or crumbly texture, and common examples
            include pie crust, tarts, croissants, and puff pastry.
            Key characteristics:
            Ingredients: Primarily flour, fat (likebackground-position: center;

            background-repeat: no-repeat;

            Texture: Can range from flaky and light (e.g., puff pastry) to firm and crumbly (e.g., shortcrust pastry),
            depending on the proportions and mixing techniques.
            Dough: The term can also refer to the dough itself,
            which is a key component in many baked items.
            Versatility: Used for both sweet and savory dishes.
            Preparation: Making pastry requires precision,
            with a focus on keeping ingredients cold and minimizing gluten
            development to achieve the desired texture.
